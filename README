The folder structure in "OODReport" is exactly how the queries are grouped and organized when you import the contents of "OOD_Report_Query_Group."
Each query file can be imported individually or you can import the entire group all at once. 

To import a query or group into JArchitect, do the following:
	Open up a project with source files and perform JArchitect's analysis (this does all of the indexing and computations needed for the queries to work).
	Open up the query or group file you want to import in some text editor
	Copy the entire contents of the file into your clipboard (or Mac/Linux equivalent)
	In the "Queries and Rules Explorers" pane, right click anywhere and select paste {"QUERY-OR-GROUP-NAME"}
	The queries should show up along with the results instantaneously
